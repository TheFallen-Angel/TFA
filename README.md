## The Story Behind The Fallen Angel

You were an angel in heaven until one day, the gods of Minecraft have decided to ban you from heaven.
With nothing but one small island and a book full of missions.
They told you that If you want to go back, you will have to improve the island using the book's instructions, and if you do, you can build the Aether portal and go back home.
